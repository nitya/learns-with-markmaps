# Welcome

My name is Nitya Narasimhan and I am a PhD, Polyglot and Parent working at the intersection of AI, Application Development and Advocacy. I am also a Visual Learner and find it useful to see the big picture around large or complex documents before I dive in. 

I find [Markmaps](https://makrkmaps.js.org/) to be particularly helpful for letting me navigate and annotate documentation trees in a way that helps me:

- visualize the depth of information in a specific topic
- connect the dots across subtrees that are otherwise invisible
- collapse/expand subtrees to get clarity and focus in learning

Explore the markmaps in this site by visiting the relevant page. **Note: You may need to refresh the page to have the markmap render).

Alternatively, use the [try it out](https://markmap.js.org/repl) feature on the official Markmaps site and copy in the URL for the raw markdown (links below) to get a more interactive version to play with.
